This is a number of tools to collect DNS data for DNSSEC analysis.

burngetzone.pl cleans a (signed) zone and extracts all domains (lnames) with DS records  
burnds.pl      collects all DNSSEC related data for later analysis (outputs JSON)  

analyze.pl     for analysis of the JSON files with DNS info  

queue.sh       for running burnds.pl with many threads  

----

Example usage, batch for a lot of domains:

# create a list from a signed zone file
burngetzone.pl -f zonefile > domainlist.txt
# run 
queue.sh domainlist.txt
# do some analysis
analyze.pl -d directory --rcode     # analyze return codes
analyze.pl -d directory --servfail  # toplist of name servers with SERVFAIL

Or just get data from a domain:

burnds.pl --pretty -n iis.se
