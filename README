There are three tools in this repository (so far). They are the fundamental tools to
collect DNS data for DNSSEC analysis.

burngetzone.pl cleans a (signed) zone and extracts all domains (lnames) with DS records
burnds.pl      collects all DNSSEC realted data for later analysis (outputs JSON)
queue.pl       for running burnds.pl, many threads

analyze.pl     for analysis of the JSON files with DNS info
